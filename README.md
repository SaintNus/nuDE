nuDE is a rendering library. At this moment, nuDE only includes MacOSX
implementation. nuDE is implemented using C++ and Objective-C++. It uses
Cocoa and OpenGL 3.2.

*This project is in development. Specifications and interfaces are
subject to change.*

## System Requirements

- MacOS X 10.7 or newer.
- XCode 4

## How to build

1. Open nuDE/nuDE.xcodeproj using XCode.
2. Build and run it.
3. That's all.

## GLSL property generator

nuShaderInfo.h is generated from a shader list using GLSL property
generator. If you need to rebuild the GLSL property compiler, you can
find the source codes and a project file in GLSLCompiler directory.

## Licenses

Haven't decided what license should I use with this project. But I can
guarantee you that you can use it freely and I will not license nuDE
using GPL or LGPL.
